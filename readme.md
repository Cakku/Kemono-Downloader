##  What's New in v3.5.0?

Version 3.5.0 focuses on enhancing access to content and providing even smarter organization:

###  Cookie Management

- **Access Content:** Seamlessly download from Kemono/Coomer as if you were logged in by using your browser's cookies.
- **Flexible Input:**
  - Directly paste your cookie string (e.g., `name1=value1; name2=value2`).
  - Browse and load cookies from a `cookies.txt` file (Netscape format).
  - Automatic fallback to a `cookies.txt` file in the application directory if "Use Cookie" is enabled and no other source is specified.
- **Easy Activation:** A simple "Use Cookie" checkbox in the UI controls this feature.
- *Important Note: Cookie settings (text, file path, and enabled state) are configured per session and are not saved when the application is closed. You will need to re-apply them on each launch if needed.*

###  Advanced `Known.txt` for Smart Folder Organization

The `Known.txt` system has been revamped for improved performance and stability. The previous method of handling known names could become resource-intensive with large lists, potentially leading to application slowdowns or crashes. This new, streamlined system offers more direct control and robust organization.

- **Fine-Grained Control:** `Known.txt`, located in the application's directory, allows you to create a personalized list of names, series titles, and keywords for precise automatic folder organization when "Separate Folders by Name/Title" is enabled.

- **How It Works (Syntax and Behavior):**
  Each line in `Known.txt` represents an entry:
  - **Simple Entries:** A line like `My Awesome Series` defines both the term to match in content (post titles, filenames, etc., based on your filter scope) and the name of the folder where matching content will be saved ("My Awesome Series").
  - **Grouped Entries (Primary Folder Name & Aliases):** To group multiple search terms under a single, specific folder name, use parentheses. The format is `(FolderName, alias1, alias2, ...)`.
    - The **first item** inside the parentheses explicitly defines the name of the folder.
    - All items within the parentheses (including the first one) are used as aliases to match against content.
    - **Example:** An entry like `(Chainsaw Man, Denji, Pochita, Makima)` means:
      - Matching content (containing "Chainsaw Man", "Denji", "Pochita", or "Makima") will be saved into a folder named "Chainsaw Man".
    - **Another Example:** `(Power, powwr, pwr, Blood Devil)` will create a folder named "Power" for content matching any of those terms.

- **Intelligent Fallback:** If "Separate Folders by Name/Title" is active, and a post's content doesn't match any terms provided in the main "Filter by Character(s)" UI input, the downloader will then consult `Known.txt`. If a match is found in `Known.txt`, the content will be organized into the folder defined by that `Known.txt` entry.

- **User-Friendly Management:**
  - You can add new simple (non-grouped) entries to `Known.txt` directly using the list and "Add" button in the UI.
  - To create or modify grouped entries, or to make more complex changes, click the "Open Known.txt" button. This will open the file in your system's default text editor. The application reloads `Known.txt` on startup or when a download process begins.

##  What's in v3.4.0? (Previous Update)
This version brings significant enhancements to manga/comic downloading, filtering capabilities, and user experience:

###  Enhanced Manga/Comic Mode

- **New "Date Based" Filename Style:**

  - Perfect for truly sequential content! Files are named numerically (e.g., `001.jpg`, `002.jpg`, `003.ext`...) across an *entire creator's feed*, strictly following post publication order.

  - **Smart Numbering:** Automatically resumes from the highest existing number found in the series folder (and subfolders, if "Subfolder per Post" is enabled).

  - **Guaranteed Order:** Disables multi-threading for post processing to ensure sequential accuracy.

  - Works alongside the existing "Post Title" and "Original File Name" styles.

---

###  "Remove Words from Filename" Feature

- Specify comma-separated words or phrases (case-insensitive) that will be automatically removed from filenames.

- Example: `patreon, [HD], _final` transforms `AwesomeArt_patreon` `Hinata_Hd` into `AwesomeArt.jpg` `Hinata.jpg`.

---

###  New "Only Archives" File Filter Mode

- Exclusively downloads `.zip` and `.rar` files.

- Automatically disables conflicting options like "Skip .zip/.rar" and external link logging.

---

###  Improved Character Filter Scope - "Comments (Beta)"

- **File-First Check:** Prioritizes matching filenames before checking post comments for character names.

- **Comment Fallback:** Only checks comments if no filename match is found, reducing unnecessary API calls.

---

###  Refined "Missed Character Log"

- Displays a capitalized, alphabetized list of key terms from skipped post titles.

- Makes it easier to spot patterns or characters that might be unintentionally excluded.

---

###  Enhanced Multi-part Download Progress

- Granular visibility into active chunk downloads and combined speed for large files.

---

###  Updated Onboarding Tour

- Improved guide for new users, covering v3.4.0 features and existing core functions.

---

###  Robust Configuration Path

- Settings and `Known.txt` are now stored in the same folder as app.

  - **Syntax:**
    - Simple entries: `My Favorite Series` (creates folder "My Favorite Series", matches "My Favorite Series").
    - Grouped entries: `(Desired Folder Name, alias1, alias2)` (creates folder "Desired Folder Name"; matches "Desired Folder Name", "alias1", or "alias2").
