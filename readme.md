## Troubleshooting

### AttributeError: module 'asyncio' has no attribute 'coroutine'

If you encounter an error message similar to:
```
AttributeError: module 'asyncio' has no attribute 'coroutine'. Did you mean: 'coroutines'?
```
This usually means that a dependency, often `tenacity` (used by `mega.py`), is an older version that's incompatible with your Python version (typically Python 3.10+).

To fix this, activate your virtual environment and run the following commands to upgrade the libraries:

```bash
pip install --upgrade tenacity
pip install --upgrade mega.py
```
