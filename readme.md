##  What's New in v3.5.0?

Version 3.5.0 focuses on enhancing access to content and providing even smarter organization:

###  Cookie Management

- **Access Content:** Seamlessly download from Kemono/Coomer as if you were logged in by using your browser's cookies.
- **Flexible Input:**
  - Directly paste your cookie string (e.g., `name1=value1; name2=value2`).
  - Browse and load cookies from a `cookies.txt` file (Netscape format).
  - Automatic fallback to a `cookies.txt` file in the application directory if "Use Cookie" is enabled and no other source is specified.
- **Easy Activation:** A simple "Use Cookie" checkbox in the UI controls this feature.
- *Important Note: Cookie settings (text, file path, and enabled state) are configured per session and are not saved when the application is closed. You will need to re-apply them on each launch if needed.*

###  Advanced `Known.txt` for Smart Folder Organization

- **Fine-Grained Control:** Take your automatic folder organization to the next level with a personalized list of names, series titles, and keywords in `Known.txt`.
- **Primary Names & Aliases:** Define a main folder name and link multiple aliases to it. For example, `([Power], powwr, pwr, Blood devil)` ensures any post matching "Power" or "powwr" (in title or filename, depending on settings) gets saved into a "Power" folder. Simple entries like `My Series` are also supported.
- **Intelligent Fallback:** When "Separate Folders by Name/Title" is active, and if a post doesn't match any specific "Filter by Character(s)" input, the downloader consults `Known.txt` to find a matching primary name for folder creation.
- **User-Friendly Management:** Add or remove primary names directly through the UI, or click "Open Known.txt" for advanced editing (e.g., setting up aliases).

##  What's in v3.4.0? (Previous Update)
This version brings significant enhancements to manga/comic downloading, filtering capabilities, and user experience:

###  Enhanced Manga/Comic Mode

- **New "Date Based" Filename Style:**

  - Perfect for truly sequential content! Files are named numerically (e.g., `001.jpg`, `002.jpg`, `003.ext`...) across an *entire creator's feed*, strictly following post publication order.

  - **Smart Numbering:** Automatically resumes from the highest existing number found in the series folder (and subfolders, if "Subfolder per Post" is enabled).

  - **Guaranteed Order:** Disables multi-threading for post processing to ensure sequential accuracy.

  - Works alongside the existing "Post Title" and "Original File Name" styles.

---

###  "Remove Words from Filename" Feature

- Specify comma-separated words or phrases (case-insensitive) that will be automatically removed from filenames.

- Example: `patreon, [HD], _final` transforms `AwesomeArt_patreon` `Hinata_Hd` into `AwesomeArt.jpg` `Hinata.jpg`.

---

###  New "Only Archives" File Filter Mode

- Exclusively downloads `.zip` and `.rar` files.

- Automatically disables conflicting options like "Skip .zip/.rar" and external link logging.

---

###  Improved Character Filter Scope - "Comments (Beta)"

- **File-First Check:** Prioritizes matching filenames before checking post comments for character names.

- **Comment Fallback:** Only checks comments if no filename match is found, reducing unnecessary API calls.

---

###  Refined "Missed Character Log"

- Displays a capitalized, alphabetized list of key terms from skipped post titles.

- Makes it easier to spot patterns or characters that might be unintentionally excluded.

---

###  Enhanced Multi-part Download Progress

- Granular visibility into active chunk downloads and combined speed for large files.

---
