## ‚ú® What's New in v6.0.0

This release focuses on providing more granular control over file organization and improving at-a-glance status monitoring.

### New Features

- **Live Error Count on Button**  
  The **"Error" button** now dynamically displays the number of failed files during a download. Instead of opening the dialog, you can quickly see a live count like `(3) Error`, helping you track issues at a glance.

- **Date Prefix for Post Subfolders**  
  A new checkbox labeled **"Date Prefix"** is now available in the advanced settings.  
  When enabled alongside **"Subfolder per Post"**, it prepends the post's upload date to the folder name (e.g., `2025-07-11 Post Title`).  
  This makes your downloads sortable and easier to browse chronologically.

- **Keep Duplicates Within a Post**  
  A **"Keep Duplicates"** option has been added to preserve all files from a post ‚Äî even if some have the same name.  
  Instead of skipping or overwriting, the downloader will save duplicates with numbered suffixes (e.g., `image.jpg`, `image_1.jpg`, etc.), which is especially useful when the same file name points to different media.

### Bug Fixes

- The downloader now correctly renames large `.part` files when completed, avoiding leftover temp files.
- The list of failed files shown in the Error Dialog is now saved and restored with your session ‚Äî so no errors get lost if you close the app.
- Your selected download location is remembered, even after pressing the **Reset** button.
- The **Cancel** button is now enabled when restoring a pending session, so you can abort stuck jobs more easily.
- Internal cleanup logs (like "Deleting post cache") are now excluded from the final download summary for clarity.

## üìÖ Next Update Plans

### üîñ Post Tag Filtering (Planned for v6.1.0)

A powerful new **"Filter by Post Tags"** feature is planned:

- Filter and download content based on specific post tags.
- Combine tag filtering with current filters (character, file type, etc.).
- Use tag presets to automate frequent downloads.

This will provide **much greater control** over what gets downloaded, especially for creators who use tags consistently.

### üìÅ Creator Download History (.json Save)

To streamline incremental downloads, a new system will allow the app to:

- Save a `.json` file with metadata about already-downloaded posts.
- Compare that file on future runs, so only **new** posts are downloaded.
- Avoids duplication and makes regular syncs fast and efficient.

Ideal for users managing large collections or syncing favorites regularly.

## Troubleshooting

### AttributeError: module 'asyncio' has no attribute 'coroutine'

If you encounter an error message similar to:
```
AttributeError: module 'asyncio' has no attribute 'coroutine'. Did you mean: 'coroutines'?
```
This usually means that a dependency, often `tenacity` (used by `mega.py`), is an older version that's incompatible with your Python version (typically Python 3.10+).

To fix this, activate your virtual environment and run the following commands to upgrade the libraries:

```bash
pip install --upgrade tenacity
pip install --upgrade mega.py
```
