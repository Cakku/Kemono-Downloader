    <h1>Kemono Downloader - Comprehensive Feature Guide</h1>
    <p>This guide provides a detailed overview of all user interface elements, input fields, buttons, popups, and functionalities available in the application.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2><strong>Main Window: Core Functionality</strong></h2>
    <p>The application is divided into a configuration panel on the left and a status/log panel on the right.</p>
    <h3><strong>Primary Inputs (Top-Left)</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>URL Input Field</strong>: This is the starting point for most downloads. You can paste a URL for a specific post or for an entire creator's feed. The application's behavior adapts based on the URL type.</li>
        <li><strong>üé® Creator Selection Popup</strong>: This button opens a powerful dialog listing all known creators. From here, you can:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Search and Queue</strong>: Search for creators and check multiple names. Clicking "Add Selected" populates the main input field, preparing a batch download.</li>
                <li><strong>Check for Updates</strong>: Select a single creator's saved profile. This loads their information and switches the main download button to "Check for Updates" mode, allowing you to download only new content since your last session.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Download Location</strong>: The primary folder where all content will be saved. The <strong>Browse...</strong> button lets you select this folder from your computer.</li>
        <li><strong>Page Range (Start/End)</strong>: These fields activate only for creator feed URLs. They allow you to download a specific slice of a creator's history (e.g., pages 5 through 10) instead of their entire feed.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2><strong>Filtering & Naming (Left Panel)</strong></h2>
    <p>These features give you precise control over what gets downloaded and how it's named and organized.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Filter by Character(s)</strong>: A powerful tool to download content featuring specific characters. You can enter multiple names separated by commas.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Filter: [Scope] Button</strong>: This button changes how the character filter works:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Title</strong>: Downloads posts only if a character's name is in the post title.</li>
                        <li><strong>Files</strong>: Downloads posts if a character's name is in any of the filenames within the post.</li>
                        <li><strong>Both</strong>: Combines the "Title" and "Files" logic.</li>
                        <li><strong>Comments (Beta)</strong>: Downloads a post if a character's name is mentioned in the comments section.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Skip with Words</strong>: A keyword-based filter to avoid unwanted content (e.g., <code>WIP</code>, <code>sketch</code>).
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scope: [Type] Button</strong>: This button changes how the skip filter works:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Posts</strong>: Skips the entire post if a keyword is found in the title.</li>
                        <li><strong>Files</strong>: Skips only individual files if a keyword is found in the filename.</li>
                        <li><strong>Both</strong>: Applies both levels of skipping.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Remove Words from name</strong>: Automatically cleans downloaded filenames by removing any specified words (e.g., "patreon," "HD").</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>File Type Filter (Radio Buttons)</strong></h3>
    <p>This section lets you choose the kind of content you want:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>All, Images/GIFs, Videos, üéß Only Audio, üì¶ Only Archives</strong>: These options filter the downloads to only include the selected file types.</li>
        <li><strong>üîó Only Links</strong>: This special mode doesn't download any files. Instead, it scans post descriptions and lists all external links (like Mega, Google Drive) in the log panel.</li>
        <li><strong>More</strong>: Opens a dialog for text-only downloads. You can choose to save post <strong>descriptions</strong> or <strong>comments</strong> as formatted <strong>PDF, DOCX, or TXT</strong> files. A key feature here is the <strong>"Single PDF"</strong> option, which compiles the text from all downloaded posts into one continuous, sorted PDF document.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2><strong>Download Options & Advanced Settings (Checkboxes)</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Skip .zip</strong>: A simple toggle to ignore archive files during downloads.</li>
        <li><strong>Download Thumbnails Only</strong>: Downloads only the small preview images instead of the full-resolution files.</li>
        <li><strong>Scan Content for Images</strong>: A crucial feature that scans the post's text content for embedded images that may not be listed in the API, ensuring a more complete download.</li>
        <li><strong>Compress to WebP</strong>: Saves disk space by automatically converting large images into the efficient WebP format.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep Duplicates</strong>: Opens a dialog to control how files with identical content are handled. The default is to skip duplicates, but you can choose to keep all of them or set a specific limit (e.g., "keep up to 2 copies of the same file").</li>
        <li><strong>Subfolder per Post</strong>: Organizes downloads by creating a unique folder for each post, named after the post's title.</li>
        <li><strong>Date Prefix</strong>: When "Subfolder per Post" is on, this adds the post's date to the beginning of the folder name (e.g., <code>2025-07-25 Post Title</code>).</li>
        <li><strong>Separate Folders by Known.txt</strong>: This enables the automatic folder organization system based on your "Known Names" list.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Cookie</strong>: Allows the application to use browser cookies to access content that might be behind a paywall or login. You can paste a cookie string directly or use <strong>Browse...</strong> to select a <code>cookies.txt</code> file.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Multithreading</strong>: Greatly speeds up downloads of creator feeds by processing multiple posts at once. The number of <strong>Threads</strong> can be configured.</li>

        <li><strong>Search...</strong>: Filters the list to quickly find a name.</li>

        <li><strong>Add New Name</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Single Name</strong>: Typing <code>Tifa Lockhart</code> and clicking <strong>‚ûï Add</strong> creates an entry that will match "Tifa Lockhart".</li>
                <li><strong>Group</strong>: Typing <code>(Boa, Hancock, Snake Princess)~</code> and clicking <strong>‚ûï Add</strong> creates a single entry named "Boa Hancock Snake Princess". The application will then look for "Boa," "Hancock," OR "Snake Princess" in titles/filenames and save any matches into that combined folder.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>‚§µÔ∏è Add to Filter</strong>: Opens a dialog with your full Known Names list, allowing you to check multiple entries and add them all to the "Filter by Character(s)" field at once.</li>
