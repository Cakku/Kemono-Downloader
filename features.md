## Download Customization

Options to further refine the download process and output.

-   **Scan Content for Images Checkbox:**

-   **Compress to WebP Checkbox:**
    -   **Purpose:** Convert downloaded images to WebP format to potentially save disk space.

        2.  The "**Separate Folders by Name/Title**" option is enabled.

## üìñ Manga/Comic Mode

Specialized mode for downloading creator feeds in a way suitable for sequential reading, like manga or comics. This mode is implicitly active when downloading from a creator URL and certain filename styles are chosen.

-   **Activation:** Primarily by downloading a creator's feed (not a single post) and selecting a relevant "Filename Style".
-   **Core Behavior:** Processes and downloads posts from the creator's feed in chronological order (oldest to newest). The "Page Range" input is typically disabled as all posts are fetched for correct sorting.

-   **Filename Style Toggle Button (located in the log area):**
    -   **Purpose:** Controls how files are named when downloading in a manga/comic-like fashion. Cycles through options on click.
    -   **Options:**
        -   `Name: Post Title` (Default for non-manga): The first file in a post is named after the post title; subsequent files in the *same post* keep their original names.
        -   `Name: Original File`: All downloaded files attempt to keep their original filenames as provided by the server. An optional "Filename Prefix" input field appears.
        -   `Name: Title+G.Num`: (Global Numbering) All files across all downloaded posts for the creator get a prefix from their respective post's title, followed by a global sequential number (e.g., `Chapter 1_001.jpg`, `Chapter 1_002.jpg`, `Chapter 2_003.jpg`). This ensures strict order across posts. Disables post-level multithreading for sequential numbering.
        -   `Name: Date Based`: Files are named sequentially (e.g., `001.jpg`, `002.jpg`) based on the post's publication date. An optional "Filename Prefix" input field appears. Disables post-level multithreading.

-   **Optional Filename Prefix Input Field (Manga Mode):**
    -   **Visibility:** Appears when "Filename Style" is set to `Name: Original File` or `Name: Date Based`.
    -   **Purpose:** Allows you to add a custom prefix to all filenames generated using these styles (e.g., `MySeries_001.jpg`).

---

## Folder Organization

Controls for how downloaded content is structured into folders.

-   **Separate Folders by Name/Title Checkbox:**
    -   **Purpose:** Creates subfolders within the main "Download Location" based on matching criteria.
    -   **Behavior:**
        -   If "**Filter by Character(s)**" is used, folders are named after the matched character(s)/group(s).
        -   If no character filter matches (or no filter is active), but the post title matches an entry in `Known.txt`, a folder named after the `Known.txt` entry is created.
        -   If neither of the above, and this option is checked, folders might be created based on post titles directly (behavior can vary).

-   **Subfolder per Post Checkbox:**
    -   **Purpose:** Creates an additional layer of subfolders, where each individual post's content goes into its own subfolder.
    -   **Behavior:** Only active if "**Separate Folders by Name/Title**" is also checked. The post subfolder will be created *inside* the character/title folder. Folder names are typically derived from sanitized post titles or IDs.

-   **`Known.txt` Management UI (Bottom Left of UI):**
    -   **Purpose:** Manages a local list (`Known.txt` file in the app directory) of series, characters, or general terms used for automatic folder organization and character filter suggestions.
    -   **Elements:**
        -   **List Display:** Shows the primary names from your `Known.txt` file.
        -   **Add New Input Field:** Enter a new name or group to add to `Known.txt`.
            -   Simple Name: e.g., `My Series`
            -   Group (creates separate entries in `Known.txt`): e.g., `(Vivi, Ulti, Uta)`
            -   Group with Aliases (single entry in `Known.txt` with `~`): e.g., `(Boa, Hancock)~`
        -   **‚ûï Add Button:** Adds the entry from the "Add New" field to `Known.txt` and refreshes the list.
        -   **‚§µÔ∏è Add to Filter Button:** Opens a dialog displaying all entries from `Known.txt` (with a search bar). Select one or more entries to add them to the "**üéØ Filter by Character(s)**" input field. Grouped names from `Known.txt` are added with the `~` syntax if applicable.
        -   **üóëÔ∏è Delete Selected Button:** Removes the currently selected name(s) from the list display and from the `Known.txt` file.
        -   **Open Known.txt Button:** Opens your `Known.txt` file in the system's default text editor for manual editing.

        -   `Scope: Artist Folders`: A subfolder is created for each artist within the main "üìÅ Download Location" (e.g., `DownloadLocation/ArtistName/`). Content from that artist (whether a full artist download or specific favorited posts from them) goes into their respective subfolder. Filters apply within each artist's context.
