# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are committed to maintaining and improving the Kemono Downloader. For the best experience and access to the latest security updates and features, we strongly recommend using the most recent versions of the application.

| Version        | Supported Status                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| >= 5.0.0       | :white_check_mark: Actively Supported  |
| 4.0.0 - 4.x.x  | :warning: Supported (Limited Features) |
| < 4.0.0        | :x: End of Life (EOL)                |

Users are encouraged to update to **v5.0.0 or newer** versions for the latest features and full support.
Versions **4.0.0 up to (but not including) 5.0.0** are considered legacy; they are supported with limited features and will primarily receive critical security updates. New feature development is focused on v5.0.0+.

## Active Maintenance

The Kemono Downloader (particularly v5.0.0+) is actively maintained. We strive to address bugs, implement new features, and improve security in a timely manner. If you discover any security vulnerabilities, please report them responsibly (details on reporting to be added if a formal process is established).

We appreciate your help in keeping Kemono Downloader secure!
